#+++++++++++++++++++++ RUN THE ANIMATION ++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
#++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

To animate the gearbox, open "Gearbox.fcstd" in FreeCAD and then make visible 
FreeCAD's python console and paste there the code of "AnimationScript.py". 
To stop the animation, type at the console:
timer.stop()

It will run as a macro too, but then you will not be able to stop it.

Have fun!
